30-Days-30-Projects
I’m challenging myself with the 30 Days 30 Projects Challenge — a journey to build 1 project every single day using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 💡 Why this challenge? ✔️ To sharpen my front-end skills ✔️ To build consistency and discipline ✔️To create 30 mini-projects worth adding to my portfolio. At the end = 30 days, 30 projects, infinite growth.
